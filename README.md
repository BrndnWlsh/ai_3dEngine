Through much trial an error, I was able to have ChatGPT 3.5 write me an entire python program to render a 3D cube and rotate this cube about a axis in space.
I then asked ChatGPT to allow for selection of said access upon startup of the program, along with a graphical user interface to prompt the use for this selection.
Overall, this small project showcases the power and relative ease of use of ChatGPT for help with coding projects, or in this case, writing entire programs by itself.
